## Hi there 👋 I'm Georgi Dechev
### And this is my portfolio:

- 🧙‍♂️ I’m currently working on ST&NS LTD company website, for which I use HTML5, CSS3, JS and Bootstrap (front-end framework).
- 🔭  You can find some small projects with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript at https://github.com/dechevgfx/myProjects
- 💻 I’m currently learning JavaScript Development in Software University
- 💬 Ask me about JS, crypto, finance and anything else. Our brains are unlimited in capacity and I think you can learn everything!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied finance at university, but surprisingly I like programming more.


<h3>🧠 At the moment I am intensively learning JavaScript I have knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 and also basic knowledge of Python.</h3>
